This is a companion GUI tool for [IBM Secure Landing Zone](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-landing-zone), primarily for deployments creating through the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/architecture/deploy-arch-ibm-slz-vpc-9fc0fa64-27af-4fed-9dce-47b3640ba739-global).

It can help create an override.json file used for configuring your deployment of Secure Landing Zone. It can also be used to modify or validate existing override.json files.
